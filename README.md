## Intro
There're 50 states in the US, so you will get 50 chances to input your answers.
If your answer is correct, the name of the state will show on the map.
In the end, the game will generate a csv file to collect all the missing state for your reference.

p.s. You can quit anytime in the middle of the game, just simply input "exit".
